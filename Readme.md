# Metalsmith example site

This example is an example of how to build a site with Metalsmith. It uses collections to organize the pages and the blog posts (which are written in Markdown), and preprocesses Stylus into CSS. To test it out yourself run:

    $ npm install
    $ node build.js

Or simply:

    $ make build
